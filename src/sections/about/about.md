  My name is Rafi Barash and I'm a Junior majoring in Computer Science at the
  University of Minnesota, with a specialization in AI and Big Data. I'm
  passionate about machine learning and big data analytics, as well as
  full-stack web development. Minnesota Club Tennis and slack-lining are also
  pretty cool. This summer I will complete a software engineering internship at
  Google.
